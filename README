My solutions for Advent of Code 2016. Written in C++, input files not submitted. Day 5, 14 and 17 need to be compiled with -lcrypto.
Day 5 has a slow execution time of approximately 50 seconds on my computer due to MD5 hashing. 
Day 14 has a slow execution time of approximately 50 seconds on my computer for the same reason.
Day 23 has a slow execution time of approximately 20 seconds on my computer because I couldn't be arsed to implement a multiplication function when it is only 20 seconds on my computer.
Day 24 was the worst task yet due to how big my solution became, which involved many ideas from other days in other years. Basically a fun combination of several. Quite quick, though, approx 0.03 seconds on my computer.
